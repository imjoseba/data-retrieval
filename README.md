# <center>Data loading and preprocessing

In this section, we have examined one of the most crucial components of the lifecycle of artificial intelligence models: data acquisition and manipulation. In the provided datasets, we have, on one hand, information related to the sample attributes and, on the other, their corresponding names:
    1. Import from the console.
    2. Read the 'data' and 'names' files.
    3. Examine the 'names' file to analyse what type of regular expressions are required to identify column names in the metadata.
    4. Apply the relevant regex transformations to obtain column names for building the data.
    5. Save the new file as CSV."
